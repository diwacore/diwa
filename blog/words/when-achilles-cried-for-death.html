            first posted on <a href="https://d-i-w-a.tumblr.com/post/667492967255261184/even-the-gods-stirred-almost-feared-the-grief-of">tumblr</a> in nov. 11, 2021!
            i remember writing this immediately after my annual re-read of the song of achilles. very heavily inspired by louise glück's "the triumph of achilles", of course.
            i also annually re-read that poem. anyways, i hope to return to this poem again (as i do with the song of achilles) and revise it as i get older (and, hopefully, wiser)!

            <hr>
            <p>even the gods stirred, almost feared<br>
            the grief of achilles who was almost god<br>
            he who was half-ocean, borne<br>
            of primal seafoam, the origin of love</p>
            
            in his arms, the part of him that was mortal:<br>
            the once tender patroclus, reduced now<br>
            to lifeless limbs what once were strong hands<br>
            for reigning in he who was half-ocean</p>
            
            almost god and still, he held him delicately then,<br>
            patroclus who was captain of achilles,<br>
            like a flower that favored the fullness of the sun<br>
            and the quiet intrigue of a westerly wind</p>
            
            achilles had had a choice once –<br>
            to be almost god, or to be almost mortal<br>
            his mistake was choosing to be a hero<br>
            like his mortal brothers in search of godhood</p>
            
            there was no heroism now, not when the part<br>
            of him that was mortal lay a corpse,<br>
            collateral of a war destined to outlive him,<br>
            a grief far too strong to make room for guilt</p>
            
            when achilles, best of the greeks,<br>
            prayed to the gods and offered the half of him<br>
            that was ocean, the divine half of him left,<br>
            it was apollo who answered</p>
            
            the whisper of an arrow, a blessing, it hits<br>
            the heel? the chest? history forgets<br>
            and achilles, who was almost god, now<br>
            choosing the half of him that was mortal</p>
            
            even the gods feared the half of him<br>
            that could rewrite destiny, death<br>
            is a mercy even the gods could not afford,<br>
            but achilles was no god –<br>
            he was half-ocean and half-patroclus</p>
